# SUMO

SUMO (Suggested Upper-Merged Ontology) has the approach of _domain_ ontologies and _merge_ ontologies. Example:

* Top level
```
            Entity
            /    \
      Abstract   Physical
      / | | \    /    |  \
  Attribute … … Object … Process
```
* Domain ontology
```
          AirportsFromAtoK
           /      |      \
     <fine-grained distinctions>
        /    /    |    \     \
    Arlanda  …    …  Heathrow  …

```

All entries in SUMO are part of a single tree, starting from `Entity`. A domain ontology about airports is linked to the top level ontology, in a distant subtree of physical entities.

TODO: I don't know how the linking works in practice, or if the technical details have any relevance to the scope of CCLAW readings. ([Niles, Pease (2001)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/505168.505170) seems to describe the merging process, read later if interested.)
