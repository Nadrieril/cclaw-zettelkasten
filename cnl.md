# Controlled Natural Language

Based on real natural languages, but restricted in some way. (Paraphrased from [SIGCNL definition](https://www.sigcnl.org/index.html).)

## Types of restrictions

### Vocabulary
Example: only words related to seafaring or instruction manuals.

### Grammar
Example: don't allow [PP attachment](https://www.gabormelli.com/RKB/Prepositional_Phrase_Attachment_Task) ambiguity:

> I saw the man with a telescope

Variations [man with a telescope] and [saw with a telescope] need to be marked explicitly:

1. I saw the (man with a telescope)  
1. I (saw with a telescope) the man

### Semantic

Example: TODO

## Purposes

### Improve communication among humans

Example: [Maritime English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Marine_Communication_Phrases)

People who work on ships need to learn a specific subset of English. When your ship hits an iceberg, you say:

> “I am fast in ice. I require assistance”.

instead of "the ship has crashed in ice, can somebody help me?"

This allows people to work on ships without knowing the full English language.

Some CNLs are designed to improve communication among humans, especially for non-native speakers of the respective natural language. In other cases, the restrictions on the language are supposed to make it easier for computers to analyze such texts in order to improve computer-aided, semi-automatic, or automatic translations into other languages. A third group of CNL has the goal to enable reliable automated reasoning and formal knowledge representation from seemingly natural texts.
