# LegalRuleML

XML-based method of writing legal rules.

Semantic Web kind of thing, linked entities, ontologies.

TODO: example of use, example code

Quoting Jason's summary:

> So it’s not for documenting laws, and it’s not for writing code, it’s for documenting logical models of laws that may be implemented in code elsewhere.
