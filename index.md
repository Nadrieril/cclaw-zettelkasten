# Overview

This is a Zettelkasten for the reading list of CCLAW@SMU.

Contributions are welcome. (Maybe this can be moved to the smucclaw repository later and the structure can make more sense.)

## Legal drafting is broken

This is the premise of the research programme.

### Legal drafting uses suboptimal workers

Humans are imprecise. They tolerate lot of things that computers wouldn't, such as:

* Incomplete information
* Semantic ambiguity, vagueness
* Syntactic ambiguity (<scope_ambiguity>, …)
* Fuzzy definitions; everyday speech vs. logical definition (<generality>, …)

### Legal drafting uses a suboptimal format
Plain text is lacking:
* Can't be checked for inconsistencies (except by humans who aren't good at it)
* Can't keep track of the overall state. If one thing changes, the rest needs to be updated manually.
