# Smart contract

Like <financial_contract>, this is also a promise of exchanging goods between parties.

Unlike traditional (financial) contract, a smart contract doesn't require third parties to make it reliable. It's reliable because it's
- Written as code. (<contracts_as_code>) This means that conditions can be automatically validated. "Did Alice pay Bob 50 dollars" is not up to negotiation, it can be checked automatically.
- Distributed publicly in a decentralized system. This means that Bob can't just burn the contract after Alice has paid (or hack the server of a single provider that hosts the contract).
