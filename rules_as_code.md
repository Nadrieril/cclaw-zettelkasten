# Rules as Code

Legal drafting = writing code.

(Remember the old days when you had to write contract in English and then <formal_models_of_legal_text>)

Useful things can be generated from that code:
- <automatic_contract_processing>
- <legal_expert_systems>
- Translation into natural language
  - most likely using a <cnl>

See also:
- <spreadsheets_for_law>
