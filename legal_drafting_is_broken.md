# Legal drafting is broken

### Legal drafting uses suboptimal workers

Humans are imprecise. They tolerate lot of things that computers wouldn't, such as:

* Incomplete information
* Semantic ambiguity, vagueness
* Syntactic ambiguity (<scope_ambiguity>, …)
* Fuzzy definitions; everyday speech vs. logical definition (<generality>, …)

### Legal drafting uses a suboptimal format
Plain text is lacking:
* Can't be checked for inconsistencies (except by humans who aren't good at it)
* Can't keep track of the overall state. If one thing changes, the rest needs to be updated manually.

Proposed solutions to fix legal drafting:

- <teach_humans>
- <summarize_for_humans>
- <spreadsheets_for_law>
- <computable_contracts>

Alternative points of view:

- <advantages_of_imprecision>
