# Legal drafting is broken

### Legal drafting uses suboptimal workers

Humans are imprecise:
* Incomplete information
* Semantically vague (<generality>, …)
* Syntactically ambiguous (<scope_ambiguity>, …)

### Legal drafting uses a suboptimal format
Plain text is lacking:
* Can't be checked for inconsistencies (except by humans who aren't good at it)
* Can't keep track of the overall state. If one thing changes, the rest needs to be updated manually.

Proposed solutions to fix legal drafting:

- <teach_humans> 
- <spreadsheets_for_law>
- <computable_contracts>

Alternative points of view:

- <advantages_of_imprecision>
