# OWL

A family of ontology languages based on Description logic. [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language)


### Naming conventions
Just wanted to link [this table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic#Terminology_compared_to_FOL_and_OWL) about naming conventions

### Relation between RDF and OWL

[RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) (Resource Description Framework) is a _data model_, where one can express relations in form of subject--predicate--object triples.

OWL is a language that can express such triples, but also other things. According to this [example in Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language#Example), OWL supports axioms about the relationships.

TODO: I'm not sure about the status of axioms: are they a mechanism beyond the RDF triples? It says elsewhere in the article that "The OWL abstract syntax presents an ontology as a sequence of annotations, axioms and facts." I'll need to read more carefully.
