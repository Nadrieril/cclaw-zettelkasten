# Ontology

Collection of concepts and their relationships, in a machine-readable format.

Kind of like this zettelkasten: here we link concepts to each other. In addition, the _links_ themselves may have types and be the subject or object in another relation, linked by something that itself has a type and can be a subject/object of yet another relation, and so on.

Contrast with a web of free text, this kind of structure allows for e.g. automated question answering.
